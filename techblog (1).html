	<p>In the video, "Humans Need Not Apply", the general claim is that humans will eventually be replaced by technology as it advances. Technology will eventually become smart enough to perform jobs that people do, but at a much better level. It doesn't apply to just less skilled jobs either, it isn't just the construction workers and the plumbers, white collar jobs are also at risk because, for example a lawyer, those jobs can be full of paperwork. It can be easy to make several mistakes due to exhaustion and human error. A robot cannot do that, a robot doesn't get tired or make as many errors as humans do. Humans can get replaced regardless of how skilled the job is, robots tackle all of these problems with ease.</p>

	<p>Personally, I believe this, it's interesting how we as a society can be the smartest race and the dumbest race at the same time. We are genuinely intelligent for our ability to create such strong technology, but at the same time, we are too ignorant to recognize how dangerous this evolution of technology is. It's scary to think that eventually, there'll be a society where robots are doing jobs humans were intended to do, where people are in the streets committing crimes to get a couple of dollars, while robots are raking in cash they don't even need. It is something we as a society are doomed to enter, I'd like to call it the age of robotics, but tha sounds boring. Meh, I wouldn't know, I'm just a human.</p>

	<p>People often leave hints that they were at a location, the most obvious situation being that humans leave behind footprints and fingerprints. Leaving a footprint, people know that they are leaving a trace of your identity there, and usually people don't care that much. It's a commonly known way of identifying that someone was at a location. Fingerprints are entirely different though, people don't really care if they leave fingerprints but its also unidentifiable to the human eye. It requires expert analysis to track someone using fingerprints, and people don't really notice that they could easily be tracked at any moment of their lives. The same thing can apply to technology, a website has the ability to access the IP adresses of every visitor on their website. Phones can track where exactly you are with your GPS, that is terrfying. It's like leaving digital fingerprints and footprints. </p>

	<p>Technology can have the power to destroy people's lives just as much as it has the power to help. When reminded by citizens of various societies, people can end up following the principle of "Big Brother" from 1984, a popular novel that details a dystopian society. In the novel, each person is always monitored, never can they feel safe because each action can be recorded and that would be the end of your reputation, or even worse your life. People in that book resemble that of people in real life, because people have the power to destroy others in both the fictitious world and the real world. Justice can be delivered or people can end up being unfairly ruined. A man built a horrible reputation for himself, 60 years old, raping many women on trains. Supposedly a girl was subject of this but she took a photo in the opes that she would be the last victim. Sure enough, the man was caught as his photo was released all over the news and he faced arrest the next day. While this does sound like a happy conclusion, analyzing it a bit more uncovers a darker aspect of this. What if the man wasn't the person raping many women, what if he wasn't even trying to rape her at all? What if the photo was edited to make the man look guilty? So many things not considered because there was no evidence, but because of the circumstances, the photo was just accepted. It's scary to think that people are so quick to accept something without a trace of evidence. and leaves a terrible tase in my mouth for what the future could end up becoming as people slowly start believing everything they see. All because the power of technology is so great, maybe a little too great.</p>

	<p>Privacy is always valued. Well, that isn't always the case. The "black box", or the more formal term, the "event data recorder", was(and still is) seen as only in airplanes. Many people don't see that this piece of technology also exists in cars, not just airplanes. As the name implies, the black box made sure to record events that occurred recently, making it ideal for tracking what happens right before a crash. But people have fears that it can do more than that, thus resulting in paranoia that these event data recorders can lead to an invasion of privacy. New York State stated that it is fine for police officers to search the EDRs of cars without a search warrant due to "bits" being fine to search, it isn't as bad as searching a home without a warrant so it's fine. The morality of being able to have a power like that is scary, as previously mentioned, it's like leaving digital fingerprints and footprints, there are things you are aware that you leave behind and some things that you aren't aware of leaving behind. This is now one of them if you drive.</p>

	<p>Personally, I find that this fear of technology essentially replacing traditional values and threatening us in a variety of ways to be justifiable, given that the past makes up much of the reasoning. It is my belief that technology is becoming extremely powerful, perhaps too powerful for humans to contain, since we are so smart, yet so foolish at the same time. </p>

		<h3>Agreement</h3>

		<p>I agree with your last paragraph saying how technology is going to be too powerful for humans. I believe it's going to fall into the wrong hands and the world is going to be done for.</p>

		<p class="tsering"><span class="interview">Tsering</span>: What's the piece of technology you're most grateful for?</p>

		<p class="mom"><span class="response">Angchung</span>: The internet, without it, life would be terrible.</p>

		<p> I like the difference and contrast your mom has to expectations about technology. It shows that not all people have the access to technology untill later ages and dont Immediatly get into computers or phones, etc. Your mom sound great and very thankful for the internet which makes everyones life much easier. üíª üì±üëè</p>
